# 🧼 No Update Pips

**No Update Pips** is a lightweight Foundry VTT module that hides the
distracting red exclamation marks ("pips") which appear in the sidebar
when a core and/or system update is available.

> Perfect for streaming, forks, offline setups, and any other clean UIs scenarios.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Hides the red update pips in the sidebar (core + system)
